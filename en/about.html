            <p class="justify1">A place to find ourselves and others through poetry, prose, music, dance and painting/drawing. A place to remember traditions, poets and writers. A place to enjoy art and culture in all it’s forms and to meet people that share the same interests. Cultural evening is the place where, through art and culture activities, we understand our individual and shared history, we discuss and share art and cultural experiences, as we consider them chronicles of our own lives or the lives of others.</p>
