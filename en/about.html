            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <p class="justify1">Looking for a space to connect with like-minded individuals through various art forms? Look no further than Cultural Evening! Our events feature music, prose, poetry, dance, painting, and drawing. We strive to honor traditions and celebrate the work of contemporary & wellknown artists.

                 Cultural Evening events are a great opportunity to meet new people who have similar interests. Through discussions and shared art & cultural experiences, we gain a deeper understanding of our individual/common history.</p>
            <h2>When</h2>
            <p class="justify1">We gather periodically to enjoy a variety of art forms: music & poetry recitals, prose, painting, photography, traditions, and life stories. Our meetings usually take place at the Naperville Public Library.</p>
            <p class="justify1">Occasionally, we choose different locations for our events; we may celebrate Mother's Day, International Women's Day, International Children's Day, or Christmas at alternate locations. To stay updated on our upcoming events, please visit the Naperville Public Library's website or feel free to email us. You can also find us on Facebook.</p>
