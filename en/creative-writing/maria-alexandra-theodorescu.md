            <p> Ally is I'm 17 years old, I am a high school student, and I live in the Chicago area, US. I love drawing, coding, photography, poetry, tennis, and bowling. I started drawing/painting when I was about 6 years old and have been doing it ever since. My work was featured at the Naperville Woman's Club's Art Fair and in local school's art fairs starting 2014 until present. I am a member of the Naperville Fine Art League as well as Arts DuPage. Digital drawing/graphics is a passion of mine and I am focusing more on it in the near future. Long term, I aim to pursue a graphic design career and/or anything related. I believe this field offers so many choices and opportunities.
            I started photography in 2015 and really like it. You can check out my work (and not only) on this website as well as on my NAL page. Since 2018 I started writing poetry. Some of my hobbies are: modeling, video making/editing and playing the guitar. Starting January 2018, I became one of 30 senior models/ambassadors (class of 2019) for Alicia's Photography.
