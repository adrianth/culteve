            <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Florin, Justin, Adelina, and Ray Barac</strong>, members of the Apel band, were born in Sibiu, Romania, and music has been a part of their lives since childhood. Their father played the guitar daily. In the 1980s, the family emigrated to the United States, one by one, facing the difficulties and challenges of leaving a communist regime and starting anew.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify">Over the years, Apel has held numerous concerts in most of the Romanian churches in the Chicago area, showcasing their religious and folk music. The Barac family has been singing for over 30 years.</p>
