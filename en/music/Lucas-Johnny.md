They are playing the piano and violin for several years now and participated in many local competitions and cultural events. Johnny and Lucas were invited to join "Seara Culturala Romaneasca" cultural events series, and to represent the young generation of artists in our community. They have learned a large repertoire of international music and, along with other students, they perform amazing duets or solos each time when present at Naperville Public Library.
