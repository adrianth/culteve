            <p style="text-align: justify">Sebastian Murariu, age 14, made his debut at the Romanian Cultural Evening in Naperville, performing Rondo alla Turca from Mozart’s Sonata No. 11. He has studied piano since the age of eight at the Naperville Music Academy under Professor Spike. Piano is one of his main passions, and as a student in the Aurora School District, he is now becoming an active member of our local cultural community.</p>
