            <strong>Anda & Stefan Cristoltean</strong> initiated a folk group starting 2016, after they had been part of Vox-Maris rock and folk band until 2015.
             Anda & Stefan are members of many cultural manifestations of Romanian folk music and poetry in Chicago area. In March 2018 they were invited to Art & Culture's cultural event, along with other artists, in supporting SPOC's noble cause of helping the children in need. Sharing the same goals of passing on to the young generations values, culture and traditions, Art & Culture Committee has an excellent collaboration with Anda & Stefan in supporting Romanian artistic and cultural manifestations within Chicago area communities.
