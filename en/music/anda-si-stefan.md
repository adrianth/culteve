            <strong>Anda & Stefan Cristoltean</strong> initiated the Retro folk group starting 2016, after they had been part of Vox-Maris rock and folk band until 2015.
             Anda & Stefan are members of this cultural manifestation of Romanian folk music and poetry in Chicago area along with other artists such as Alina Celia Cumpan, Ligia Grindeanu, Ana Munteanu Draghici etc. You can find out more about Retro <a href="https://www.cenaclulretro.org/">here</a>. In March 2018 they joined Art & Culture's cultural event, along with Alina Celia Cumpan, in supporting SPOC's noble cause of helping the children in need. Anda & Stefan are promoters of Romanian tradition and culture along with all Retro members. Sharing the same goals of passing on to the young generations values, culture and traditions, Art & Culture Committee has an excellent collaboration with Anda & Stefan and with Retro folk group in joining, participating and supporting Romanian artistic and cultural manifestations within Chicago area communities.
