            An unforgettable evening, full of youth, good spirits, and tradition.
            The Cultural Evening family in Naperville grew this year, joined by the Romanian-American Choir from Chicago led by Mrs. Nicoleta Roman & Mr. Liviu Roman. The Naperville library echoed today with crystalline voices: The Romanian-American Choir from Chicago was founded by Mezzo-Soprano Nicoleta Roman, a vocal and piano teacher, a lyrical artist at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, alongside her husband, Dr. Liviu Roman. Wishing to keep alive the flame of Romanian tradition, patriotic songs, and the sweet Romanian language, they thought it would be good to dedicate their time to the musical education of many Romanian children in the American community. The Romanian American Chicago Choir is a standalone non-profit organization. We had the pleasure of hearing them perform the National Anthem of Romania and that of our adoptive country, America! We listened with joy to sacred Romanian carols from the Romanian repertoire. In the end, we were carried away on the magical threads of childhood, feeling grateful alongside this special group. Thanks to instructors Nicoleta & Liviu for their passion and dedication to the Romanian-American community!
