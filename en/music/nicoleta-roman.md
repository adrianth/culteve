            <p>The Romanian-American Choir from Chicago was founded by Mezzo-Soprano Nicoleta Roman, a vocal and piano teacher, a lyric artist at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, alongside her husband, Dr. Liviu Roman.</p>

            <p>Wishing to keep alive the flame of Romanian tradition, patriotic songs, and the sweet Romanian language, they thought it would be good to dedicate their time to the musical education of many Romanian children in the American community. The Romanian American Chicago Choir is a standalone non-profit organization.</p>
            
            <p>The Romanian Cultural Evening family of Naperville grew in 2023, joined by the Romanian-American Choir from Chicago led by Mrs. Nicoleta Roman & Mr. Liviu Roman. The Naperville library echoed on December 2nd, with crystalline voices; It was an unforgettable evening, full of youth, good spirits, and tradition. The beautiful couple along with their students brought so much joy & happiness to the hearts of both young and old. They enriched the experience by incorporating quitar, accordion, and piano into the show, turning the event into a full house. We had the pleasure of hearing them perform the National Anthem of Romania and that of our adoptive country, America in December 2023! We listened with joy to sacred Romanian carols from the Romanian repertoire. In the end, we were carried away on the magical threads of childhood, feeling grateful alongside this special group. Thanks to instructors Nicoleta & Liviu for their passion and dedication to the Romanian-American community!</p>
