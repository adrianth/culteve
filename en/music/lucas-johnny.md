They have been playing the piano and the violin since their elementary school years and have participated in many local competitions and cultural events. In 2019, they joined the "Seara Culturala Romaneasca" cultural event series, where they represent the young generation of artists in our community.

With a large repertoire of international music, Johnny and Lucas deliver amazing duets or solos every time they perform at "Seara Culturala Romaneasca." They have been bringing joy and happiness at Seara Culturala Romaneasca through their piano and violin performances for five years now.
