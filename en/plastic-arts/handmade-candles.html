                        <strong>Handmade candles workshops</strong> During our handmade candle workshops, we will be using soy wax as the primary wax for container candles, and blended waxes for pillar and molded candles. In terms of decorations, we will be providing a variety of options, including dry flowers and leaves, as well as semi-precious stones. We will also be using natural oils for fragrance, ensuring that the scents of our candles are both high-quality and environmentally friendly. We look forward to sharing our passion for candle-making with you and creating beautiful, personalized candles together.
