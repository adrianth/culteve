    <h2>Maria Alexandra Theodorescu</h2>
    <a href="http://www.allyth.me/">Ally Th personal site & blog </a> - Maria Alexandra (Ally) Theodorescu is a graduate student from DePaul University, Chicago, where she majored in Computer Science with a Software Development Concentration and a Data Science minor. At present, Ally is pursuing her Master's in Data Science within the same university. When she's not busy studying, Ally enjoys expressing her creativity through painting, drawing, and photography. She first exhibited her artwork at the Naperville Fine Art Gallery exhibition in 2016 and subsequently maintained her own online art gallery for four years. In 2018, Ally's drawings and paintings were published in "Creneluri Sighisorene," an East European cultural publication, in the Young Artists section. Her artistic contributions were recognized when she received "The Pursuit of Excellence" Award from the Art Department at Neuqua Valley High School in 2019. The drawings, paintings, and photographs on display here were created between 2015 and 2019. Although Ally is currently focused on biomedical research, painting, drawing, and photography remain her primary hobbies.
