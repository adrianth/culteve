    <h2>Ally</h2>
    <a href="http://www.allyth.me/">Ally Th personal site & blog </a> - Meet Ally, Computer Science graduate student, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science. In her free time, she is cultivating her artistic skills by painting, drawing, and learning more about photography. In 2016, Ally showcased her art work at the Naperville Fine Art Gallery and maintained an online art gallery for four years.

    In 2018, her drawings and paintings were featured in the Young Artists section of "Creneluri Sighisorene," an East European cultural publication. Notably, she was honored with "The Pursuit of Excellence" Award from the Art Department at Neuqua Valley High School in 2019.
    
    The exhibited drawings, paintings, and photographs reflect Ally's creative output from 2015 to 2019. At present, while working full time & studying, she still remains committed to her core hobbies whenever she has some free time.
