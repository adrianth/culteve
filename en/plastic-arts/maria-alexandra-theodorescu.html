    <h2>Maria Alexandra Theodorescu</h2>
    <a href="http://www.allyth.me/">Ally Th personal site & blog </a> - Ally Theodorescu is a graduate student from DePaul University in Chicago, where she majored in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development and a minor in Data Science. Despite her busy academic schedule, Ally has found time to explore her artistic side through hobbies such as painting, drawing, and photography. Her talent in these areas was recognized when she exhibited her artwork at the Naperville Fine Art Gallery in 2016, and maintained her own online art gallery for four years. In 2018, Ally's drawings and paintings were featured in "Creneluri Sighisorene," an East European cultural publication, in the Young Artists section. Additionally, she received "The Pursuit of Excellence" Award from the Art Department at Neuqua Valley High School in 2019.

    The drawings, paintings, and photographs on display here were all created by Ally between 2015 and 2019. While her focus is currently on biomedical research, Ally remains dedicated to her primary hobbies of painting, drawing, and photography. It's inspiring to see someone with such a diverse range of talents and interests pursuing their passions, and we wish Ally all the best in her academic and creative endeavors.
