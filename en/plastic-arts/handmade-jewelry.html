                            <strong>Handmade necklaces & brooches</strong> Our group is committed to giving back to the community by donating all of the handmade jewelry and crafts created by our volunteers to local schools, community groups, and social causes. We are proud to support local organizations that are making a positive impact on our community. By creating handmade items with love and care, we hope to bring joy and comfort to those who receive them. Our volunteers are dedicated to using their skills and creativity to make a difference in the lives of others, and we are grateful for their contributions to our cause.
